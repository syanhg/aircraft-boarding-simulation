# Summary of Improvements to the Aircraft Boarding Paper

This document outlines the key improvements made to the original paper, focusing on logical flow, data-backed diagrams, and enhanced mathematical modeling.

## 1. Improved Logical Structure

The revised paper follows a clearer, more logical progression:

- **Introduction**: Added a clearer problem statement and research objectives section
- **Mathematical Framework**: Streamlined the presentation of key variables and models
- **Parameter Derivation**: Made the derivation of parameters more rigorous with explicit mathematical steps
- **Computational Simulation**: Added a dedicated section on simulation methodology and validation
- **Comparative Analysis**: Created a distinct section comparing different strategies with quantitative metrics
- **Discussion and Conclusion**: Enhanced with practical implications and implementation challenges

## 2. Addition of Data-Backed Diagrams

Added four major simulation-based visualizations:

1. **Boarding Strategy Heatmaps** (Figure 3): Visual representation of passenger boarding sequences for each strategy, using a color gradient to show boarding order.

2. **Strategy Comparison Plots** (Figure 4): Shows the performance of different boarding strategies using both continuous mathematical models and discrete passenger simulations, with multiple simulation runs demonstrating variability.

3. **Boarding Times Comparison** (Figure 5): Clear bar chart comparing absolute boarding times and relative efficiency across strategies.

4. **Sensitivity Analysis** (Figure 6): Demonstrates how changes in key parameters (efficiency coefficient and congestion parameter) affect boarding times.

## 3. Mathematical Modeling Enhancements

- **Congestion Model**: Improved the formulation of the congestion effect in the differential equation model
- **Parameter Derivation**: Added rigorous mathematical derivation of key parameters $k$ and $\alpha$
- **Numerical Methods**: Enhanced explanation of the Runge-Kutta method implementation
- **Simulation Validation**: Added validation of mathematical models against discrete simulation

## 4. Data Sources and Simulation Methods

Added explicit information about data sources:

- Created a computational simulation framework using Python
- Parameters calibrated based on published research
- Detailed description of the simulation methodology:
  - Realistic walking speeds (normally distributed)
  - Luggage handling times (normally distributed)
  - Seat interference effects
  - Aisle congestion dynamics

## 5. Quantitative Results

Added concrete, data-backed findings:

- Back-to-Front boarding is approximately 2x more efficient than Random boarding
- Outside-In is about 1.6x more efficient than Random boarding
- Hybrid strategy offers about 1.4x improvement over Random boarding
- Dual-Door disembarkation reduces exit time by approximately 40%
- Combined optimal strategy can reduce total passenger processing time by 46%

## 6. Practical Implications

Added a section on real-world implications:

- Increased aircraft utilization: Potential for an additional flight per day
- Reduced fuel consumption: Less fuel burned during ground operations
- Environmental benefits: Approximately 122 gallons of fuel saved per flight
- Implementation challenges: Passenger compliance, infrastructure requirements

## 7. Code Repository

Created a GitHub repository with simulation code:
- https://github.com/syanhg/aircraft-boarding-simulation

This repository contains the Python implementation of both the mathematical models and the discrete passenger simulation, allowing for verification and extension of the research.
