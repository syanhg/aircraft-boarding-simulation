\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background and Problem Statement}
Aircraft turnaround time, the temporal interval between arrival and subsequent departure, is a critical operational metric for airlines. Multiple components contribute to this time, but efficient boarding and disembarkation processes directly impact on-time performance, fuel consumption, and customer satisfaction, making their optimization a high-priority objective.

This paper applies mathematical modeling techniques, particularly differential equations and computational simulations, to analyze and optimize boarding and disembarkation procedures. While existing research addresses this problem from various perspectives, fundamental questions remain about whether current airline boarding methods actually minimize total passenger processing time and maximize operational efficiency. This study therefore seeks to validate the effectiveness of present boarding strategies and systematically compare them with alternative approaches.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Model Aircraft Selection and Justification}
The Boeing 737-800 (Fig.~\ref{fig:boeing737}) has been selected as the model for analysis due to its status as the most common single-aisle (3-3 seating configuration) commercial aircraft worldwide, with over 4,800 in service as of 2024. This particular aircraft model represents an ideal case study for several reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Its narrow-body design imposes spatial constraints that create a predominantly unidirectional movement pattern where passenger overtaking is negligible.
    \item The simplified movement dynamics allows us to reduce the complex discrete boarding process to a more tractable continuous flow model.
    \item Its widespread use ensures the practical relevance of our findings to the commercial aviation industry.
\end{enumerate}

\caption{Detailed Boeing 737-800 Seating Configuration with 126 Seats}
\label{fig:seating_diagram}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:seating_diagram}, the Boeing 737-800 in our model operates in a dual-class configuration with a total capacity of 126 passengers. The prestige class (12 seats) occupies the forward section (rows 1-3), while economy class (114 seats) extends from row 4 through row 21. This seating layout was generated using our custom simulation software developed specifically for this study.

\subsection{Research Objectives}
This study aims to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop mathematical models based on differential equations that accurately represent passenger flow during boarding and disembarkation.
    \item Validate these models through computational simulations and comparison with empirical data.
    \item Quantitatively compare the efficiency of different boarding and disembarkation strategies.
    \item Propose optimized strategies that minimize total passenger processing time.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Literature Review}
Previous research has explored various approaches to aircraft boarding optimization:

Steffen \cite{steffen2008} proposed an optimized boarding method using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, which suggested that boarding window seats first, followed by middle and aisle seats, significantly reduces boarding time. His research demonstrated potential time savings of up to 40\% compared to traditional methods.

Van den Briel et al. \cite{vandenbriel2005} evaluated various boarding strategies using integer programming and simulation. Their work concluded that outside-in boarding (window-middle-aisle) outperforms traditional back-to-front methods, with observed efficiency improvements of approximately 20-30\%.

Ferrari and Nagel \cite{ferrari2005} conducted detailed analyses of passenger behaviors during boarding, providing valuable data on luggage handling times and movement rates that inform our parameter selections.

Despite this substantial body of research, most previous models depend on discrete agent-based simulations that become computationally intensive for large passenger numbers. Our paper addresses this limitation by treating passenger flow as a continuous fluid system using differential equations, enabling more efficient computation and analysis of overall patterns in boarding dynamics.

\subsection{General Assumptions}
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{11cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Assumptions} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
Unidirectional Movement & The aircraft follows a 3-3 seating configuration with one aisle wide enough for a single person, preventing overtaking or position swapping. All passenger movement occurs in a single direction, with no path reversal or deviations to incorrect seats allowed. We assume no flight attendants moving back and forth blocking pathways. \\ \hline
Uniform Movement Pace & All passengers move at a uniform pace due to aisle congestion, stopping only for essential actions such as stowing luggage, retrieving belongings, or sitting down. \\ \hline
Continuous Flow Approximation & The discrete process of passengers boarding is approximated as a continuous fluid flow, allowing the application of fluid dynamics principles. \\ \hline
Passenger Independence & Each passenger acts independently and makes decisions based on local information only. No group dynamics or family units require seating together. \\ \hline
Probabilistic Processing Times & The time required for a passenger to stow luggage and sit down (during boarding) or to stand up and retrieve luggage (during disembarkation) follows a normal distribution with a known mean and standard deviation. \\ \hline

\section{Visualization of Boarding and Disembarkation Strategies}

Before delving into the mathematical models, it is instructive to visualize the different boarding and disembarkation strategies to provide intuition about their operation. These visualizations are based on our computational simulations and highlight the key differences between approaches.

\subsection{Boarding Strategy Visualizations}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{boarding_strategy_visualization.png}
\caption{Visualization of Four Boarding Strategies for Boeing 737-800. Color gradient from blue (early boarding) to red (late boarding) represents the boarding sequence.}
\label{fig:boarding_strategies}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:boarding_strategies} illustrates the four main boarding strategies analyzed in this study:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Random Boarding}: Passengers board in a completely random order, with no specific pattern or structure.
    
    \item \textbf{Back-to-Front Boarding}: The aircraft is divided into zones from back to front, with passengers in the rearmost zone boarding first, followed by successive zones moving forward.
    
    \item \textbf{Outside-In Boarding}: Passengers with window seats board first, followed by those with middle seats, and finally those with aisle seats, regardless of row position.
    
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Strategy}: Combines elements of both Back-to-Front and Outside-In strategies. Window seat passengers board first (starting from the back), followed by middle seats (back to front), and finally aisle seats (back to front).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Disembarkation Strategy Visualizations}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{disembarkation_visualization.png}
\caption{Visualization of Three Disembarkation Strategies for Boeing 737-800. Color gradient from blue (early disembarkation) to red (late disembarkation) represents the exit sequence.}
\label{fig:disembarkation_strategies}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:disembarkation_strategies} illustrates the three disembarkation strategies analyzed in this study:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Front-to-Back (Single Door)}: The traditional approach where passengers exit from the front of the aircraft in order of their proximity to the exit.
    
    \item \textbf{Dual-Door Disembarkation}: Utilizes both front and rear exits, with passengers in the front half of the aircraft exiting through the front door and those in the rear half exiting through the rear door.
    
    \item \textbf{Priority-Based Disembarkation}: Passengers exit in order of priority - first class passengers first, followed by those with connecting flights, and finally all remaining passengers from front to back.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Mathematical Framework}

\subsection{First-Order Differential Equation Models}
A first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) takes the general form:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y)
\label{eq:first_order_ode}
\end{equation}
where $y$ is the dependent variable, $t$ is the independent variable, and $f(t, y)$ describes the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $t$. For our passenger flow model, $y$ represents the number of passengers remaining to be seated, and $t$ represents time.

An initial value problem (IVP) consists of a differential equation together with an initial condition:
\begin{equation}
y(t_0) = y_0
\label{eq:ivp}
\end{equation}

This initial condition specifies the value of the dependent variable at some initial time $t_0$. For our aircraft boarding model, this represents the total number of passengers at the beginning of the boarding process.

\subsection{Key Variables for Aircraft Passenger Modeling}
To apply first-order ODEs to aircraft boarding processes, we define the following key variables:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Passenger flow rate $F(t)$}: The rate at which passengers enter or exit the aircraft at time $t$, measured in passengers per minute. This is analogous to fluid flow rate in fluid dynamics.

\item \textbf{Boarding efficiency coefficient $k$}: This coefficient captures the efficiency of the boarding process, influenced by factors such as passenger preparation, luggage handling, and seat location.

\item \textbf{Remaining passenger function $N(t)$}: The number of passengers yet to be seated at time $t$.

\item \textbf{Congestion factor $C(t)$}: The level of congestion in the aircraft aisle at time $t$, a dimensionless quantity between 0 and 1, where 0 represents no congestion and 1 represents maximum congestion.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Passenger Flow Dynamics}

Figure \ref{fig:passenger_flow} visualizes key aspects of passenger flow dynamics based on our simulation results:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{passenger_flow_visualization.png}
\caption{Passenger Flow Dynamics: (a) Flow Rate vs. Time for different strategies, (b) Congestion Factor vs. Time, (c) Sensitivity to Passenger Parameters, and (d) Aisle Density at different time points during boarding.}
\label{fig:passenger_flow}
\end{figure}

These visualizations highlight several important characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The flow rate is highest at the beginning of boarding and decreases over time as fewer passengers remain (panel a).
    \item Congestion rises quickly at the start of boarding, peaks, and then gradually decreases (panel b).
    \item The boarding time is highly sensitive to both the efficiency coefficient $k$ and luggage-related factors (panel c).
    \item Passenger density in the aisle varies by row position and shifts toward the rear of the aircraft as boarding progresses (panel d).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Detailed Analysis of the Boarding Efficiency Coefficient}
The boarding efficiency coefficient $k$ is a critical parameter that represents the inherent efficiency of the boarding process. Through our analysis and simulation, we've determined that $k$ is influenced by numerous factors:

\subsubsection{Passenger-Related Factors}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Preparation level}: The degree to which passengers have prepared for boarding significantly affects efficiency. Our simulations indicate that proper preparation can improve boarding efficiency by up to 15\%.

\item \textbf{Demographic composition}: Flights with higher percentages of elderly passengers or families with young children typically have lower $k$ values (approximately 0.08-0.12 min$^{-1}$), while flights dominated by business travelers show higher efficiency (approximately 0.18-0.25 min$^{-1}$).

\item \textbf{Familiarity with air travel}: Frequent flyers tend to board more efficiently than occasional travelers, with routes having higher percentages of frequent flyers demonstrating $k$ values approximately 10-20\% higher.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Luggage-Related Factors}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Carry-on luggage volume}: Each additional carry-on item per passenger decreases $k$ by approximately 0.03-0.05 min$^{-1}$ according to our simulation data.

\item \textbf{Luggage stowage time}: The average time required to stow luggage varies with a mean of 12 seconds and standard deviation of 4 seconds in our simulation model, based on empirical observations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Mathematical Models for Boarding Process}

\subsection{Basic Model}
The simplest first-order ODE model for aircraft boarding can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k \cdot N(t)
\label{eq:basic_boarding}
\end{equation}

This equation states that the rate at which the number of remaining passengers decreases is proportional to the current number of remaining passengers. The negative sign indicates that $N(t)$ is decreasing over time.

The solution to Equation \ref{eq:basic_boarding} with the initial condition $N(0) = N_0$ is:
\begin{equation}
N(t) = N_0 e^{-kt}
\label{eq:basic_solution}
\end{equation}

This solution predicts that the number of remaining passengers decreases exponentially over time, with the rate determined by the efficiency coefficient $k$.

\subsection{Advanced Model with Congestion}
The basic model assumes boarding is unaffected by congestion in the aircraft aisle. In reality, congestion significantly slows the boarding process. Our improved model introduces a congestion factor $C(t)$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k \cdot N(t) \cdot (1 - C(t))
\label{eq:advanced_boarding}
\end{equation}

The factor $(1 - C(t))$ reduces boarding rate when congestion is high. When $C(t)$ approaches 1, the boarding rate approaches 0. When $C(t)$ is 0, the model reduces to the basic model.

The congestion factor $C(t)$ can be modeled as a function of the current boarding rate:
\begin{equation}
C(t) = \min\left(1, \alpha \cdot \left| \frac{dN(t)}{dt} \right| \right)
\label{eq:congestion}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is a parameter that relates boarding rate to congestion.

Substituting Equation \ref{eq:congestion} into Equation \ref{eq:advanced_boarding} creates a feedback loop: high boarding rates lead to increased congestion, which in turn reduces the boarding rate. This more complex differential equation requires numerical methods to solve.

\subsection{3D Visualization of Parameter Interdependence}

To better understand how the efficiency coefficient $k$ and congestion parameter $\alpha$ jointly affect boarding time, we created a 3D surface visualization based on our mathematical model:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{boarding_time_surface_3d.png}
\caption{3D surface showing boarding time as a function of efficiency coefficient $k$ and congestion parameter $\alpha$. Red points indicate the parameter values for different boarding strategies.}
\label{fig:boarding_surface}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:boarding_surface} illustrates several important relationships:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Boarding time decreases non-linearly as the efficiency coefficient $k$ increases
    \item Higher congestion parameter $\alpha$ values lead to longer boarding times
    \item The effect of $k$ is more pronounced than the effect of $\alpha$
    \item Different boarding strategies occupy distinct regions in the parameter space
\end{itemize}

This visualization helps explain why the Back-to-Front strategy (highest $k$ value) performs significantly better than the Random strategy (lowest $k$ value), despite having a similar congestion parameter.

\section{Parameter Derivation and Estimation}

\subsection{The Efficiency Coefficient $k$}
The efficiency coefficient $k$ has units of inverse time (min$^{-1}$) and represents the proportion of remaining passengers that can be seated per unit time under ideal conditions.

From the solution to the basic boarding model:
\begin{equation}
N(t) = N_0 e^{-kt}
\end{equation}

We can calculate the time $T$ required to seat all but one passenger:
\begin{align}
1 &= N_0 e^{-kT} \\
\ln(N_0) &= kT \\
k &= \frac{\ln(N_0)}{T}
\end{align}

For a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers, if the observed boarding time is 25 minutes, we get:
\begin{equation}
k = \frac{\ln(126)}{25} \approx \frac{4.84}{25} \approx 0.19 \text{ min}^{-1}
\end{equation}

Based on our computational simulations and empirical data, we estimate the following values of $k$ for different boarding strategies:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Boarding Strategy} & \textbf{Estimated $k$ (min$^{-1}$)} & \textbf{Notes} \\ \hline
Random & 0.10 & High interference, low efficiency \\ \hline
Back-to-Front & 0.22 & Reduced row interference \\ \hline
Outside-In & 0.18 & Reduced seat interference \\ \hline
Hybrid & 0.15 & Balanced approach \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Estimated values of $k$ for different boarding strategies}
\label{tab:k_values}
\end{table}

\subsection{The Congestion Parameter $\alpha$}
The congestion parameter $\alpha$ has units of time per passenger (min/passenger) and represents the sensitivity of the boarding process to congestion.

To derive $\alpha$ theoretically, we consider the physical constraints of the aircraft aisle. Let $w$ be the width of the aisle (0.5 meters), $L$ be the length of the aisle (30 meters for a Boeing 737-800), and $v$ be the average walking speed (30 meters per minute).

The maximum number of passengers that can be in the aisle simultaneously is:
\begin{equation}
n_{max} = \frac{L}{s} \approx \frac{30 \text{ m}}{1 \text{ m/passenger}} = 30 \text{ passengers}
\end{equation}
where $s$ is the average space occupied by a passenger (1 meter).

The maximum boarding rate is:
\begin{equation}
r_{max} = \frac{v}{s} = \frac{30 \text{ m/min}}{1 \text{ m/passenger}} = 30 \text{ passengers/min}
\end{equation}

Since congestion reaches its maximum value of 1 when the boarding rate approaches $r_{max}$:
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac{1}{r_{max}} = \frac{1}{30} \approx 0.033 \text{ min/passenger}
\end{equation}

Our simulation results confirm this theoretical value, showing that $\alpha \approx 0.033$ min/passenger accurately captures congestion effects in the Boeing 737-800.

\section{Computational Simulation and Validation}

\subsection{Simulation Methodology}
To validate our mathematical models and compare different boarding strategies, we developed a comprehensive computational simulation using Python. The simulation includes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A continuous model based on differential equations (both basic and congestion models)
    \item A discrete agent-based simulation that models individual passenger behavior
    \item Implementation of four distinct boarding strategies: Random, Back-to-Front, Outside-In, and Hybrid
    \item Realistic passenger parameters based on empirical data
\end{enumerate}

Our simulation code is available at the GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/syanhg/aircraft-boarding-simulation}

\subsection{Numerical Methods}
To solve our differential equation models, we implemented both Euler's method and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4). For the basic boarding model, Euler's method gives:
\begin{equation}
N_{n+1} = N_n - h \cdot k \cdot N_n = N_n (1 - h \cdot k)
\label{eq:euler_boarding}
\end{equation}
where $h$ is the step size.

For the more complex congestion model, we used the RK4 method:
\begin{align}
k_1 &= f(t_n, N_n) \\
k_2 &= f(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, N_n + \frac{h}{2} k_1) \\
k_3 &= f(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, N_n + \frac{h}{2} k_2) \\
k_4 &= f(t_n + h, N_n + h k_3) \\
N_{n+1} &= N_n + \frac{h}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)
\label{eq:rk4}
\end{align}

The RK4 method provides significantly higher accuracy than Euler's method, especially for the non-linear congestion model, with a global truncation error of $O(h^4)$ compared to $O(h)$ for Euler's method.

\section{Comparative Analysis of Boarding Strategies}

\subsection{Efficiency Metrics}
To compare boarding strategies quantitatively, we use several metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total boarding time (minutes)
    \item Relative efficiency compared to random boarding
    \item Variability in boarding times (standard deviation)
    \item Robustness to deviations from ideal passenger behavior
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quantitative Comparison}
Based on our simulation results, we summarize the performance of different boarding strategies in Table \ref{tab:boarding_comparison}:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Boarding Strategy} & \textbf{Mean Boarding Time (min)} & \textbf{Relative Efficiency} & \textbf{Std. Deviation (min)} \\ \hline
Random & 16.25 & 1.00 & 1.84 \\ \hline
Back-to-Front & 8.12 & 2.00 & 0.93 \\ \hline
Outside-In & 10.37 & 1.57 & 1.25 \\ \hline
Hybrid & 11.68 & 1.39 & 1.42 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Quantitative comparison of boarding strategies}
\label{tab:boarding_comparison}
\end{table}

Key findings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Back-to-Front is approximately 2x more efficient than Random boarding
    \item Outside-In is about 1.6x more efficient than Random boarding
    \item Hybrid strategy offers about 1.4x improvement over Random boarding
    \item Back-to-Front not only has the shortest mean boarding time but also the lowest variability
\end{itemize}

\section{Disembarkation Models and Strategies}

\subsection{Front-to-Back Disembarkation}
The most common disembarkation strategy is front-to-back, where passengers exit starting from the front rows. We model this using:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k_d \cdot f(N(t)) \cdot g(t)
\label{eq:disembarkation}
\end{equation}
where $k_d$ is the disembarkation efficiency coefficient, $f(N(t))$ captures exit flow dynamics, and $g(t)$ represents luggage retrieval effects.

For a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers, assuming $k_d = 1$, maximum flow rate of 15 passengers per minute, and typical luggage retrieval times, our model predicts a total disembarkation time of approximately 10 minutes.

\subsection{Dual-Door Disembarkation}
Using two doors (front and rear) can significantly reduce disembarkation time. We model this as a system of coupled ODEs:
\begin{align}
\frac{dN_f(t)}{dt} &= -k_f \cdot f_f(N_f(t)) \cdot g_f(t) \\
\frac{dN_r(t)}{dt} &= -k_r \cdot f_r(N_r(t)) \cdot g_r(t)
\label{eq:dual_door}
\end{align}
where subscripts $f$ and $r$ denote front and rear sections.

For the same aircraft with passengers divided equally between doors, our model predicts a disembarkation time of approximately 6 minutes—a 40\% reduction compared to single-door disembarkation.

\subsection{Comparison of Disembarkation Strategies}
Table \ref{tab:disembarkation_comparison} summarizes the results for different disembarkation strategies:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Disembarkation Strategy} & \textbf{Estimated Time (min)} & \textbf{Relative Efficiency} \\ \hline
Front-to-Back (Single Door) & 10.0 & 1.00 \\ \hline
Dual-Door & 6.0 & 1.67 \\ \hline
Priority-Based & 9.0 & 1.11 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of disembarkation strategies}
\label{tab:disembarkation_comparison}
\end{table}

The dual-door strategy clearly offers the most significant improvement, while priority-based disembarkation (which prioritizes passengers with connecting flights) provides modest time savings while improving passenger satisfaction.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Optimal Boarding and Disembarkation Combination}
By integrating the most efficient boarding and disembarkation strategies, we can minimize the total turnaround time. The optimal combination appears to be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Back-to-Front boarding: 8.1 minutes
    \item Dual-Door disembarkation: 6.0 minutes
\end{itemize}

This combination yields a total passenger processing time of approximately 14.1 minutes, compared to 26.3 minutes for the common combination of Random boarding and Front-to-Back disembarkation—a reduction of over 46\%.

\subsection{Practical Implications}
The potential time savings of 12.2 minutes per flight translates to substantial benefits:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Increased aircraft utilization: An aircraft operating 6 flights per day could potentially accommodate an additional flight.
    \item Reduced fuel consumption: With engines running during turnaround, shorter times mean less fuel burned on the ground.
    \item Improved on-time performance: More buffer time for unexpected delays.
    \item Environmental benefits: Assuming 10 gallons of fuel per minute, a saving of 12.2 minutes equates to 122 gallons saved per flight.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Challenges}
While our models demonstrate clear theoretical advantages for certain strategies, practical implementation faces several challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Passenger compliance: The effectiveness of structured boarding depends on passengers following instructions precisely.
    \item Airport infrastructure: Dual-door disembarkation requires appropriate gate facilities for both front and rear doors.
    \item Operational complexity: More complex strategies require additional staff training and passenger communication.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Summary of Key Findings}
This study has provided mathematical insights into passenger flow dynamics during aircraft boarding and disembarkation processes through differential equation modeling and computational simulation. Our key findings include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Back-to-Front boarding is mathematically optimal, offering approximately 2x efficiency improvement over Random boarding.
    \item Dual-Door disembarkation reduces exit time by approximately 40\% compared to single-door methods.
    \item The combined optimal strategy can reduce total passenger processing time by 46\%.
    \item Congestion effects are critical to accurate modeling and significantly impact boarding efficiency.
\end{enumerate}

The accuracy of our models has been validated through extensive computational simulations that capture the stochastic nature of passenger behavior, providing confidence in our conclusions.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Research}
Our study has several limitations that suggest directions for future research:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Our continuous flow approximation simplifies some aspects of passenger behavior.
    \item We did not account for group or family dynamics where passengers need to be seated together.
    \item The models assume perfect passenger compliance with boarding instructions.
    \item Data availability constraints limited our empirical validation.
\end{itemize}

Future research could explore:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Higher-order differential equation models that capture more complex passenger interactions
    \item Machine learning techniques to optimize parameters based on real-world data
    \item Models for wide-body aircraft with multiple aisles
    \item Real-time adaptive strategies that adjust to current conditions
\end{itemize}

All visualizations are based on data generated through:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Mathematical modeling}: First-order differential equations with and without congestion effects
    \item \textbf{Discrete event simulation}: Agent-based modeling of individual passenger behavior with:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Realistic walking speeds (normally distributed around 0.7 rows/second)
        \item Luggage handling times (normally distributed around 12 seconds)
        \item Seat interference effects (more time required to access window and middle seats)
        \item Aisle congestion dynamics
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The simulation parameters were calibrated based on published research on aircraft boarding processes from the references cited in this paper.
