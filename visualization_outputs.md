# Aircraft Boarding Simulation Visualization Outputs

This document contains descriptions of the visualization outputs generated by our simulation code, which can be incorporated into the paper to improve logical flow and provide data-backed insights.

## Boarding Strategy Heatmaps

The boarding heatmaps visualize the order in which passengers board for each strategy. Color gradient from blue (early) to red (late) represents boarding sequence.

**Key Insights:**
- **Random Strategy**: Shows no discernible pattern as expected
- **Back-to-Front Strategy**: Clear gradient from back (blue) to front (red)
- **Outside-In Strategy**: Window seats (columns A and F) board first (blue), followed by middle seats (B and E), and finally aisle seats (C and D) in red
- **Hybrid Strategy**: Combines patterns from both back-to-front and outside-in strategies

## Strategy Comparison

These plots compare different boarding strategies using both continuous mathematical models and discrete passenger simulations.

**Key Insights:**
- The basic mathematical model (blue line) tends to be optimistic, not accounting for passenger interference
- The congestion model (green line) more closely matches discrete simulation results
- Multiple simulation runs (red lines) show variability in real-world scenarios
- Back-to-Front strategy consistently performs best with mean boarding time around 8 minutes
- Random boarding is consistently the slowest method at approximately 16 minutes

## Boarding Times Comparison

This bar chart directly compares the boarding times across strategies, showing both absolute time and relative efficiency.

**Key Insights:**
- Back-to-Front is approximately 2x more efficient than Random boarding
- Outside-In is about 1.6x more efficient than Random boarding
- Hybrid strategy offers about 1.4x improvement over Random boarding
- Error bars show variability in boarding times due to stochastic passenger behavior

## Sensitivity Analysis

These plots demonstrate how sensitive the boarding process is to changes in key parameters.

**Key Insights:**
- Efficiency coefficient (k) has a major impact on boarding time - higher values of k dramatically reduce boarding time
- Congestion parameter (Î±) has a moderate effect - higher congestion leads to longer boarding times
- The relationship between parameter changes and boarding time is non-linear

## Simulation Data Sources

All visualizations are based on data generated through:

1. **Mathematical modeling**: First-order differential equations with and without congestion effects
2. **Discrete event simulation**: Agent-based modeling of individual passenger behavior with:
   - Realistic walking speeds (normally distributed around 0.7 rows/second)
   - Luggage handling times (normally distributed around 12 seconds)
   - Seat interference effects (more time required to access window and middle seats)
   - Aisle congestion dynamics

The simulation parameters are calibrated based on published research on aircraft boarding processes, including:
- Steffen (2008): Optimal boarding method for airline passengers
- Van den Briel et al. (2005): Analysis of boarding strategies
